Text: Yijia is interested in the portrayal of human connections and coming-of-age experience in the saturated age of the 21st Century. Currently, she works with multiple forms of printmaking, including lithography, large-scale relief, intaglio, and mixed-media. The formal aspects of the work give a sense of movement and transience. The images are a fusion of representational and abstract forms that evoke both a deviation from reality and a sense of displacement. Instead of making a distinction between the reality and the imaginary, Yijia is more fascinated by the hazy and immersive qualities of ambivalence. In this fast-paced, digitized, and globalized world, growing up becomes a different experience. In her work, the image of adolescence becomes a metaphor for uncertainty and a gray area between two worlds. Ambivalence exists in the absence of a mediator, and adolescence comes to permeate the space in between. As a printmaker, she creates large-scale woodcuts and combines different printmaking methods as a means to produce images. Through the distortion of figures, spontaneous marks, and heavy layering, she aims to create texture and personality in the lines. The scale of her work varies greatly. She is compelled by the idea of depicting a small, transient moment on a large canvas or, compressing a universal, collective feeling in a small frame. The specific, distinct action between her figures is crucial to the larger socio-political context she is thinking about. Her work explores a wide range of adolescent experiences, including sentiments unique to first-generation immigrants and the transgression formed under the modern family structure. <br><br><br>
